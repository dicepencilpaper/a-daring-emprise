# A Daring Emprise
Medieval fantasy role-playing game by Dice Pencil and paper.

## Welcome, daring adventurer!

This is a world of...

## The adventurer

You participate in this world through your *adventurer*, a daring, courageous individual that is ready to face whatever fate throws at them! Your adventurer will have two to four _professions_, which determine the skills and abilities they possess. The number of professions picked is up to the player.
 
### Professions

A profession encompasses a relatively wide skill set. Here are a few examples for some professions:

- Metalsmith
- Merchant
- Thief
- Explorer
- Painter
- Politician
- Soldier
- Musician

 Note that professions do not have expressly detailed skills and abilities; rather, it is expected that everyone uses common sense and creativity when using professions. Does an action performed under a certain profession makes sense to everyone? Then it is valid! For example, it is expected that someone with the profession of _musician_ is good at understanding musical instruments, composition, and knowledgeable of music history. But a creative use of this profession could enable them to be really good at persuading people, simply based on their experience as public performers. Be flexible and creative!

All adventurers have one basic profession, *adventurer*, which determines their proficiency in the following areas:

- Combat prowess and skill with basic weapons. This does not include advanced martial weapons like a trebuchet, siege engines, and such.
- Travel skills such as basic map reading, and a good sense of direction. 
- Basic survival techniques like setting camp, building fires, cooking, fishing, small-prey hunting, and foraging.

To determine how proficient the adventurer is at each on of their professions, assign a die to each one based on your personal preference, with *d6* being way above average, all the way down to below average at *d12*. Each die assignment must be unique.

As an example, Runah the Wanderer has the following professions:

- Hunter (d6)
- Adventurer (d8)
- Sailor (d10)

When your adventurer is trying to perform a task for which they have no knowledge, you will have to roll for success using the *d20* die.

### Body and Mind 

Your adventurer also has two stats that determine their physical and mental resistance. These are *body* and *mind*. To set them, select a unique die for each stat, just like with professions: for adventurers, usually one of the stats will have a d6, and the other a d8. However, different to professions, a *higher die* means a better stat.

#### Body

Body determines your adventurer's resistance to damage received and exhaustion. There are two tracking scores related to body, *body hits (BH)* and *body wounds (BW)*. Every time your adventurer is the target of a successful attack (or anything that causes bodily harm), add 1 to your BH score. This means that the first time your adventurer receives damage, BH would be 1, second time receiving damage BH goes up to 2, and so on.

After jotting this down, roll your body die. You need to roll a number higher than your current BH avoid receiving a body wound. If you roll equal or lower to your BH, you will add 1 to your current BW score. If your adventurer reaches a BW score higher than their body die value (for example, getting 7 BW when your body die is a d6), they will automatically be *unconscious* and out of commission.

>  As an option, When your adventurer has 1 or more BW, they will perform any physical actions at one cumulative die higher than their profession die per each BW point. For example, if they have d8 for adventurer, all subsequent actions related to this profession will be performed with a d10 at 1 BW, d12 at 2 BW, and d20 at 3 or more BW.

#### Mind

Similarly to body, a player will roll their mind die when they are the target of any attack or effect that might affect their mind and mental well-being. It also has two associated tracking scores, *mind hits (MH)* and *mind wounds (MW)*. When your adventurer is the target of a successful mental attack (via magic, potions, or any other thing that might hurt their psyche), add 1 to your MH score.

After setting your MH, roll your mind die. If you roll higher than your MH, your adventurer avoid receiving a mind wound. If you roll equal or lower to your MH, your adventurer has been mentally wounded and you will add 1 to your current MW score. If your adventurer reaches a MW score higher than their mind die value, they will automatically be *unconscious* and out of commission.

> As an option, when your adventurer has 1 or more HW, they will perform any mental actions at one cumulative die higher than their profession die per each HW point.

## Actions

Any activity or task that requires knowledge and skill is called an *action*. Every action has a difficulty range as shown below:

| Difficulty   | Max Success Value |
|--------------|-------------------|
| Average      | 5                 |
| Complicated  | 4                 |
| Difficult    | 3                 |
| Brutal       | 2                 |
| Unattainable | 1                 |

 The *max success value* column for each difficulty level determines the maximum value that needs to be rolled on a die to succeed at an action. For example, for an *average* action, you would succeed on a roll of 1-5, while for an *unattainable* action, only a 1 would succeed. It is expected that tasks that could be considered easier than average will succeed automatically, unless your adventurer is trying to perform under stressful or difficult circumstances. At that point, the coordinator will determine an appropriate difficulty level for the action.

Actions include combat maneuvers. Speaking of which...

## Combat

Actual combat consists of multiple actions taking place simultaneously. However, this is extremely difficult (if not impossible) to achieve in a game. Therefore, we will use a system composed of *rounds* and *turns*, with the order set through *initiative*.

### Initiative

At the start of combat, all players and the coordinator will roll 1d8 each. The action order will then be established by the roll results in ascending order. The coordinator must take care to annotate the initiative order for reference.

### Rounds and turns

Once the initiative is set, combat begins! This is the start of the round, which encompasses all the plays by all participants. 

To perform an attack, you use the *adventurer* profession, unless they have another profession that might guarantee a better result based on the weapon or method being used to make the attack. For example, an adventurer that is better as a *hunter* than as an *adventurer* can use their *hunter* die when using a weapon such as a longbow.

To set the difficulty level of the attack, we will compare the attack die against their opponent's attack die, and use the table below to determine the maximum success value.

| Attacker Die | d6 | d8 | d10 | d12 | d20 | 
|--------------|----|----|-----|-----|-----|
| d6           | 2  | 3  | 4   | 5   | 5   |
| d8           | 1  | 2  | 3   | 4   | 5   |
| d10          | 1  | 1  | 2   | 3   | 4   |
| d12          | 1  | 1  | 1   | 2   | 3   |
| d20          | 1  | 1  | 1   | 1   | 2   |

As an example, if your adventurer will use a d8 for their strike, and your opponent has a d10 as their attack die, you need to roll 1-3 to succeed on your attack.
