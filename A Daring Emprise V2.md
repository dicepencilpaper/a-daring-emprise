## Welcome, daring adventurer!

This is a world of...

## The adventurer

You participate in this world through your *adventurer*, a daring, courageous individual that is ready to face whatever fate throws at them! Your adventurer will have two to four _professions_, which determine the skills and abilities they possess. The number of professions picked is up to the player.
 
### Professions

A profession encompasses a relatively wide skill set. Here are a few examples for some professions:

- Metalsmith
- Merchant
- Thief
- Explorer
- Painter
- Politician
- Soldier
- Musician

 Note that professions do not have expressly detailed skills and abilities; rather, it is expected that everyone uses common sense and creativity when using professions. Does an action performed under a certain profession makes sense to everyone? Then it is valid! For example, it is expected that someone with the profession of _musician_ is good at understanding musical instruments, composition, and knowledgeable of music history. But a creative use of this profession could enable them to be really good at persuading people, simply based on their experience as public performers. Be flexible and creative!

All adventurers have one basic profession, *adventurer*, which determines their proficiency in the following areas:

- Combat prowess and skill with basic weapons. This does not include advanced martial weapons like a trebuchet, siege engines, and such.
- Travel skills such as basic map reading, and a good sense of direction. 
- Basic survival techniques like setting camp, building fires, cooking, fishing, small-prey hunting, and foraging.

To determine how proficient the adventurer is at each on of their professions, assign a die to each one based on your personal preference, with *d6* being way above average, all the way down to below average at *d12*. Each die assignment must be unique.

As an example, Runah the Wanderer has the following professions:

- Hunter (d6)
- Adventurer (d8)
- Sailor (d10)

When your adventurer is trying to perform a task for which they have no knowledge, you will have to roll for success using the *d20* die.

### Body and mind

Your adventurer also has two stats that determine their physical and mental resistance. These are *body* and *mind*. To set them, select a unique die for each stat, just like with professions: for adventurers, usually one of the stats will have a d6, and the other a d8. However, different to professions, a *higher die* means a better stat.

#### Body

This determines your adventurer's resistance to damage received and exhaustion. Every time your adventurer is the target of anything that causes bodily harm, you need to add up that attack number in your character sheet as *body hits*. The first time your adventurer receives damage, body hits would be 1, second time receiving damage it goes up to 2, and so on. After jotting this down, roll your *body* die. You need to roll a number higher than your hits to avoid being *physically wounded*. If you fail your roll, add 1 to your

When your adventurer is *physically wounded*, they will perform any actions at one cumulative die higher than their profession die. For example, if they have d8 for *adventurer*, all subsequent actions related to this profession will be performed with a d10 after the first time they are wounded, d12 after the second one, and d20 thereafter.

If your character gets hit a number of times greater than their *body* die value (for example, getting hit seven times when your *body* die is a d6), they will automatically be *unconscious* and out of commission.

#### Mind

Similarly to body, a player will roll their mind die when they are the target of any attack or effect that might affect their mind and mental well-being.

## Actions

Any activity or task that requires knowledge and skill is called an *action*. Every action has a difficulty range, as shown below:

| Difficulty | Max Success Value  |
|------------|--------------------|
| Easy       | 5                  |
| ??         | 4                  |
| Average    | 3                  |
| ??         | 2                  |
| Hard       | 1                  |

The *max success value* column for each difficulty level determines the maximum value that needs to be rolled on a die to succeed at an action. For example, for an *average* action, you would need to roll 1 to 3, for a *hard* action, only a 1 would succeed, and for an easy action, rolling from 1 to 5 guarantees success.

Actions include combat maneuvers. Speaking of which...

## Combat

To perform an attack, you use the *adventurer* profession, unless your adventurer has another profession that might guarantee a better result based on the weapon or method being used to make the attack. For example, an adventurer that is better as a *hunter* than as an *adventurer* might then use their *hunter* die when using a weapon such as a longbow.

To set the difficulty level of the attack, we will compare the attack die against their opponent's attack die, and use the table below to determine the maximum success value.

| Attacker Die | d6 | d8 | d10 | d12 | d20 | 
|--------------|----|----|-----|-----|-----|
| d6           | 2  | 3  | 4   | 5   | 5   |
| d8           | 1  | 2  | 3   | 4   | 5   |
| d10          | 1  | 1  | 2   | 3   | 4   |
| d12          | 1  | 1  | 1   | 2   | 3   |
| d20          | 1  | 1  | 1   | 1   | 2   |

As an example, if your adventurer will use a d8 for their strike, and your opponent has a d10 as their attack die, you need to roll 1-3 to succeed on your attack.
