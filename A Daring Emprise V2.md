## Welcome, daring adventurer!

This is a world of...

## The adventurer

You participate in this world through your *adventurer*, a daring, courageous individual that is ready to face whatever fate throws at them! Your adventurer will have two to four _professions_, which determine the skills and abilities they possess. The number of professions picked is up to the player.

 
### Professions

A profession encompasses a relatively wide skill set. Note that these skills and abilities are not expressly detailed; rather, use common sense and creativity when using these professions. For example, it is expected that someone with the profession of _musician_ is good at understanding musical instruments, composition, and knowledgeable of music history. But a creative use of this profession could enable them to be really good at persuading people, simply based on their experience as public performers. Be flexible and creative!

All adventurers have one basic profession, *adventurer*, which determines their combat prowess, their travel skills, ...

To determine how proficient the adventurer is at each on of their professions, assign a die to each one based on how good you want the adventurer to be in that particular profession, with *d6* being way above average, all the way down to below average at *d12*. Each die assignment must be unique.

As an example, Runah the Wanderer has the following professions:

- Adventurer (d8)
- Explorer (d6)
- Sailor (d12)
- Hunter (d10)

Note that there are no combat-specific professions in Runah's list. Does this means that they cannot handle a weapon effectively? They definitely can! As a hunter, Runah could be proficient with the bow, the dagger, and probably a sling. However, they are probably not good with swords and sword-fighting.

When your adventurer is trying to execute a task for which they have no knowledge, you will have to roll for success using the *d20* die.

### Body and mind

Your adventurer also has two basic stats that determine their physical and mental resistance. These are called *body* and *mind*, and to set them, you need to select a unique die for each one just like with professions: for adventurers, usually one of the stats will have a d6, and the other a d8.

#### Body

This determines your adventurer's resistance to damage received and exhaustion. When your adventurer is the target of a successful attack (or anything else that could cause bodily harm), you roll the *body* die. The roll result needed to avoid being *wounded* is based on how many times your adventurer has been hit. The first time your character is hit, they need to roll more than 1 on their *body* die to avoid being wounded. The second time your character is hit, you need to roll more than 2, and so on.

When your adventurer is wounded, they will perform any actions at one cumulative die higher than their profession die. For example, if they have an *adventurer* die of d8, all actions related to this profession will be performed with a d10 after the first time they are wounded, d12 after the second one, and d20 thereafter.

If your character gets hit a number of times greater than their *body* die value (for example, getting hit seven times when your *body* die is a d6), they will automatically be *unconscious* and out of commission.


#### Mind

Similarly to body, a player will roll their mind die when they are the target of any attack or effect that might affect their mind and mental well-being.

## Actions

Any activity or task that requires knowledge and skill is called an *action*. Every action has a difficulty range, as shown below:

| Difficulty | Max Success Value  |
|------------|--------------------|
| Easy       | 5                  |
| ??         | 4                  |
| Average    | 3                  |
| ??         | 2                  |
| Hard       | 1                  |

The *max success value* column for each difficulty level determines the maximum value that needs to be rolled on a die to succeed at an action. For example, for an *average* action, you would need to roll 1 to 3, for a *hard* action, only a 1 would succeed, and for an easy action, rolling from 1 to 5 guarantees success.

Actions include combat maneuvers. Speaking of which...

## Combat

To perform an attack, you use the *adventurer* profession, unless your adventurer has another profession that might guarantee a better result based on the weapon or method being used to make the attack. For example, an adventurer that is better as a *hunter* than as an *adventurer* might then use their *hunter* die when using a weapon such as a longbow.

To set the difficulty level of the attack, we will compare the attack die against their opponent's attack die, and use the table below to determine the maximum success value.

| Attacker Die | d6 | d8 | d10 | d12 | d20 | 
|--------------|----|----|-----|-----|-----|
| d6           | 2  | 3  | 4   | 5   | 5   |
| d8           | 1  | 2  | 3   | 4   | 5   |
| d10          | 1  | 1  | 2   | 3   | 4   |
| d12          | 1  | 1  | 1   | 2   | 3   |
| d20          | 1  | 1  | 1   | 1   | 2   |

As an example, if your adventurer will use a d8 for their strike, and your opponent has a d10 as their attack die, you need to roll 1-3 to succeed on your attack.
