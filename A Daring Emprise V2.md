# A Daring Emprise
Medieval fantasy role-playing game by Dice Pencil and paper.

## Welcome, daring adventurer!

This is a world of...

## Participants

A session of A Daring Emprise is composed of one to four people that will be controlling their *adventurers*, and one player who is in charge of presenting the situations, scenes, and controlling the rest of the universe's entities. This player is known as the *coordinator*, as they take care of running the game in an orderly fashion and making sure things are fair for everyone.

## The adventurer

Asa player, you participate in this world through your *adventurer*, a daring, courageous individual that is ready to face whatever fate throws at them! Your adventurer will have two to four _professions_, which determine the skills and abilities they possess. The number of professions picked is up to the player.
 
### Professions

A profession encompasses a relatively wide skill set. Here are a few examples for some professions:

- Metalsmith
- Merchant
- Thief
- Explorer
- Painter
- Politician
- Soldier
- Musician

 Note that professions do not have expressly detailed skills and abilities; rather, it is expected that everyone uses common sense and creativity when using professions. Does an action performed under a certain profession makes sense to everyone? Then it is valid! For example, it is expected that someone with the profession of _musician_ is good at understanding musical instruments, composition, and knowledgeable of music history. But a creative use of this profession could enable them to be really good at persuading people, simply based on their experience as public performers. Be flexible and creative!

All adventurers have one basic profession, *adventurer*, which determines their proficiency in the following areas:

- Combat prowess and skill with basic weapons. This does not include advanced martial weapons like a trebuchet, siege engines, and such.
- Travel skills such as basic map reading, and a good sense of direction. 
- Basic survival techniques like setting camp, building fires, cooking, fishing, small-prey hunting, and foraging.

To determine how proficient the adventurer is at each on of their professions, assign a die to each one based on your personal preference, with *d6* being way above average, all the way down to below average at *d12*. Each die assignment must be unique.

As an example, Runah the Wanderer has the following professions:

- Hunter (d6)
- Adventurer (d8)
- Sailor (d10)

When your adventurer is trying to perform a task for which they have no knowledge, you will have to roll for success using the *d20* die.

### Wellbeing 

The *wellbeing* die determines your adventurer's physical and mental resistance. Usually, your adventurer starts with **d8** as their wellbeing die. 

#### Assigning your wellbeing die

There are two methods for this. The first one is to roll 1d10 and consulting the table below:

| Roll 1d10 | Wellbeing Die |
|-----------|---------------|
| 1-3       | d6            |
| 4-7       | d8            |
| 8-9       | d10           |
| 10        | d12           |

The second alternative is to have the coordinator assign a die value based on your adventurer's professions. As an example, an adventurer with a profession that focuses on highly physical activities such as a soldier could have a high wellbeing die, while someone that comes from a very sedentary lifestyle like a scholar would have a lower die.

### Weapons, armor, & equipment

Your adventurer needs to be equipped for the dangers they will face exploring the unknown! Make sure to give your character gear that matches their professions and style.

Most inventory items occupy *inventory slots (IS)*, which is a representation of both weight and volume. Some really light and/or small items will have an IS value of 0. To determine how many slots your adventurer has available, multiply your wellbeing die value by 2. For example, if your adventurer has a d8 for wellbeing, they will have 16 slots available for inventory.

#### Weapons

There are two types of weapons: *light (L)*, *heavy (H)* and *martial (M)*. A light weapon inflicts 1 WP, a heavy weapon inflicts 2 WP, and a martial weapon inflicts 3 WP. Martial weapons can only be used by those who have a profession that relates to the military or other similar experience, like a bounty hunter.

Weapons have another characteristic: *range*. This indicates the farthest reach for that weapon, and this normally applies to missile or thrown weapons. Range is measured in *zones*, with 1 zone being equal to 25 ft / 8 m. A zone of 0 indicates melee range.

| Weapon               | Type | Range | IS |
|----------------------|------|-------|----|
| Dagger               | L    | 1     | 1  |
| Hand axe             | L    | 1     | 1  |
| Short sword          | L    | 0     | 1  |
| Hammer               | L    | 1     | 1  |
| Sling                | L    | 4     | 0  |
| Long sword           | H    | 0     | 2  |
| Battle axe           | H    | 0     | 2  |
| Warhammer            | H    | 0     | 2  |
| Mace                 | H    | 0     | 2  |
| Bow                  | H    | 10    | 1  |
| Two-handed sword     | M    | 0     | 3  |
| Great axe            | M    | 0     | 3  |
| Crossbow             | M    | 8     | 2  |

#### Armor

Your adventurer might wear armor to be protected from combat damage. Armor makes it more difficult to be wounded in combat or other dangerous situations by reducing your adventurer's *defense* score. This is explained in detail in the *Combat* section below.

Similar to weapons, armor has light, heavy, and martial types, and just like with weapons, only adventurers with a profession that requires extensive combat training can wear martial type armor.

| Armor                         | Defense Reduction | IS |
|-------------------------------|-------------------|----|
| Light (padded, leather)       | -1                | 2  |
| Heavy (chainmail, scale mail) | -2                | 4  |
| Martial (plate mail)          | -3                | 8  |
| Shield (any size)             | -1                | 2  |

#### Gear

In addition to weapons, your adventurer needs some gear that will keep them safe in their travels, as well as keeping them fed and hydrated. This includes items like rations, a waterskin, torches, a lamp, rope, and other items that can help on an adventure. The IS value of these items is dependent on their size and/or function, as follows:

- Containers suchs as bags, backpacks, and sacks have an IS of 0.
- Items up to the size of a regular shield (about 4 sq ft/ 0.4 sq m) have an IS of 1.
- Items larger than a shield will have an IS of 2.
- Exceptions to the size ruling for IS need to be taken on a case per case basis. For example, something like an anvil will not be too large, but will definitely have around 6 IS!
- Coins will have an IS of 0 for up to 200 coins, and +1 IS for every other 200 coins.

## Actions

Any activity or task that requires knowledge and skill is called an *action*. Every action has a difficulty range as shown below:

| Difficulty   | Success Value |
|--------------|---------------|
| Average      | 5             |
| Complicated  | 4             |
| Difficult    | 3             |
| Brutal       | 2             |
| Unattainable | 1             |

 The *success value (SV)* column for each difficulty level determines the highest value that needs to be rolled to succeed at an action. For example, for an *average* action, you would succeed on a roll of 1-5, while for an *unattainable* action, only a 1 would succeed. It is expected that tasks that could be considered easier than average will succeed automatically, unless your adventurer is trying to perform under stressful or difficult circumstances. At that point, the coordinator will determine an appropriate difficulty level for the action.

## Combat

Actual combat consists of multiple actions taking place simultaneously. However, this is extremely difficult (if not impossible) to achieve in a game. Therefore, we will use a system composed of *rounds* and *turns*, with the order set through *initiative*.

### Initiative

At the start of combat, all players and the coordinator will roll a die as specified in the following table:

| Inventory slots percentage | IS 12 | IS 16 | IS 20 | IS 24 | Initiative Die |
|------------------------------------|-------|-------|-------|----------------|
| Up to 25%                  | 3     | 4     | 5     | 6     | d6             |
| Up to 50%                  | 6     | 8     | 10    | 12    | d8             |
| Up to 75%                  | 9     | 12    | 15    | 18    | d10            |
| Up to 100%                 | 12    | 16    | 20    | 24    | d12            |

The coordinator will ideally roll for each monster group, although they can choose to roll initiative for each opponent if they wish to.

The action order will then be established by the roll results in ascending order. In the case of a tie, the players can choose who goes first. If the tie is between a player and any of the coordinator's group of enemies, the player has the advantage. The coordinator must annotate the initiative order for reference.

### Rounds and turns

Once the initiative is set, combat begins! This is the start of the round, which encompasses all the plays by all participants. Each player participates in their turn, as set by the initiative order.

### Move
 
If able to do so, combat participants can move before *or* after their attack, and as an action in their *riposte* (explained below). They can also choose to not move at all. Movement, like weapon range, is defined in zones. Your adventurer can move a maximum of 1 zone per  

### Attack

To perform an attack, you use the *adventurer* die roll. The difficulty level of the attack is set by the target's *defense* stat, which goes from 2 to 5. This defense stat is modified by things such as armor, shields, and any other modifiers that might apply, as explained in the *Defense* segment below. Regardless of the target's defense, a roll of 1 will always hit a target under regular circumstances. 

#### Defense

As specified above, the defense stat establishes how difficult it is for your adventurer to hit a target in combat, as well as how difficult it is for your adventurer to be hit. The base value for this stat is 5, which in human terms is someone with no armor or any other type of protection, and this number is reduced by the following cummulative factors:

- Armor: As specified in the Equipment -> Armor section above, each armor type reduces the defense by a specified amount. Some creatures might have natural armor, too.
- Cover: Someone behind 50% or more cover will reduce their defense by -2 in addition to any other benefits such as armor.
- There might be additional factors from -1 to -5 that are related to things like magic, or a creature's special characteristic.

### Riposte

The target of an attack, if still conscious and capable, can immediately strike back in return even if it is not their turn in terms of initiative. This is called a riposte, and it makes combat more dynamic, dangerous, and unpredictable. The target of a riposte cannot riposte in return.

Even after playing their riposte, they will still get to play their turn as determined by initiative, and in the same manner their target will be able to respond back to the attack with their own riposte, if possible.

### Damage

The wellbeing die is used to manage damage received in combat or other dangerous situations. There are two tracking scores related to wellbeing, *hit points (HP)* and *wound points (WP)*. Every time a combatant is the target of a successful attack (or anything else that causes bodily or mental harm), add 1 HP. For example, the first time they receive damage, they will have 1 HP, second time, 2 HP, and so on.

After jotting this down, the player rolls their wellbeing die. If the wellbeing roll is higher than the combatant's current HP, they avoid being wounded. If the roll is equal or lower than their HP, the player has to add the attack damage points to their current WP score, based on the attack's damage rating.

If the combatant reaches a WP score higher than their wellbeing die (for example, reching 9 or more wound points when their wellbeing die is a d8), they will automatically be *unconscious* and out of commission.

#### Death

If the combatant receives more than one and a half times their wellbeing die in WP, they will die. For example, an adventurer with a wellbeing of d6 will die if they receive more than 9 WP.
