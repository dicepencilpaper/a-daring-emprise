# A Daring Emprise
Medieval fantasy role-playing game by Dice Pencil & Paper.

## Welcome!

This is a world of low fantasy and high stakes! Take your adventurer to dangerous quests into dark caves, mysterious dungeons, mystical towers, and more. It is a world of low technology, warring kindgoms, and dangerous monsters lurking everywhere. Be courageous, be brave, don your armor, and create stories that will be retold for ages!

### Participants

A session of A Daring Emprise is composed of one to four people that will be playing with their *adventurers*, and one player who is in charge of presenting the situations, scenes, and controlling the rest of the universe's entities. This player is known as the *coordinator*, as they take care of running the game in an orderly fashion and making sure things are fair for everyone.

## The adventurer

Your adventurer is a daring, courageous individual that is ready to face whatever fate throws at them! Your adventurer will have two to four _professions_, which determine the skills and abilities they possess. The number of professions picked is up to the player.
 
### Professions

A profession encompasses a relatively wide skill set. Here are a few examples for some professions:

- Metalsmith
- Merchant
- Thief
- Explorer
- Painter
- Politician
- Soldier
- Musician

 Note that professions do not have detailed skills and abilities; rather, it is expected that everyone uses common sense and creativity when using professions. Does an action performed under a certain profession makes sense to everyone? Then it is valid! For example, it is expected that someone with the profession of _musician_ is good at understanding musical instruments, composition, and knowledgeable of music history. But a creative use of this profession could enable them to be really good at persuading people, simply based on their experience as public performers. Be flexible and creative!

All adventurers have one basic profession, *adventurer*, which determines their proficiency in the following areas:

- Combat prowess and skill with basic weapons. This does not include advanced martial weapons, as clarified in the *Combat* section.
- Travel skills such as basic map reading, and a good sense of direction. 
- Basic survival techniques like setting camp, building fires, cooking, fishing, small-prey hunting, and foraging.

To determine how proficient the adventurer is at each on of their professions, assign a die to each one based on your personal preference, with **d6** being way above average, all the way down to below average at **d12**. Each die assignment must be unique and not repeated on any profession.

As an example, Runah the Wanderer has the following professions:

- Hunter (d6)
- Adventurer (d8)
- Sailor (d10)

When your adventurer is trying to perform a task for which they have no knowledge, you will have to roll for success using the **d20** die. These dice are used to determine the success or failure of special actions that require skill. The *Actions* section explains how this works.

### Wellbeing 

The *wellbeing die (WB)* determines your adventurer's physical and mental resistance. Usually, your adventurer starts with **d8** as their wellbeing die. A higher wellbeing die indicates a more robust adventurer.

#### Assigning your wellbeing die

There are two methods for this. The first one is to roll 1d10 and consulting the table below:

| Roll 1d10 | Wellbeing Die |
|-----------|---------------|
| 1-3       | d6            |
| 4-7       | d8            |
| 8-9       | d10           |
| 10        | d12           |

The second alternative is to have the coordinator assign a die value based on your adventurer's professions. As an example, an adventurer with a profession that focuses on highly physical activities such as a soldier could have a high wellbeing die, while someone that comes from a very sedentary lifestyle like a scholar would have a lower die.

### Weapons, armor, & equipment

Your adventurer needs to be equipped for the dangers they will face exploring the unknown! Make sure to give your character gear that matches their professions and style.

#### Weapons

There are three types of weapons: *light (L)*, *heavy (H)* and *martial (M)*. Each type of weapon inflicts different amounts of damage as detailed in the *Combat* section. Martial weapons can only be used by those who have a profession that relates to the military or other similar experience.

Some weapons have another characteristic: *range*. This indicates the farthest reach for that weapon when it is fired or thrown. Range is measured in *zones*, with 1 zone being equal to 25 ft / 8 m. A zone of 0 indicates melee range.

| Weapon               | Type | Range |
|----------------------|------|-------|
| Dagger               | L    | 1     | 
| Hand axe             | L    | 1     |
| Short sword          | L    | -     |
| Hammer               | L    | 1     |
| Sling                | L    | 4     |
| Long sword           | H    | -     |
| Battle axe           | H    | -     |
| Warhammer            | H    | -     |
| Mace                 | H    | -     |
| Bow                  | H    | 10    |
| Two-handed sword     | M    | -     |
| Great axe            | M    | -     |
| Crossbow             | M    | 8     |

#### Armor

Your adventurer can wear armor to protect them from physical damage. Similar to weapons, armor has light, heavy, and martial types, and only adventurers with a profession that provides extensive combat training can wear martial type armor.

Your adventurer has a base *Defense* score of 5, which can be reduced by the *defense reduction* value shown in the table below. The lower the score, the better protected your adventurer is.

| Armor                         | Defense Reduction |
|-------------------------------|-------------------|
| Light (padded, leather)       | -1                |
| Heavy (chainmail, scale mail) | -2                |
| Martial (plate mail)          | -3                |
| Shield (any size)             | Additional -1     |

#### Gear

In addition to weapons, your adventurer needs some gear that will keep them safe in their travels, as well as keeping them fed and hydrated. This includes items like rations, a waterskin, torches, a lamp, rope, and other items that can help on an adventure. Not having a required item for an action can result in an increased difficulty for the action target!

## Actions

Any activity or task that requires knowledge and skill is called an *action*. This includes using your adventurer's profession skills, and also combat actions such as attacking a target. Every action has a difficulty range as shown below:

| Difficulty   | Action Target |
|--------------|---------------|
| Average      | 5             |
| Complicated  | 4             |
| Difficult    | 3             |
| Brutal       | 2             |
| Unattainable | 1             |

 The *action target (AT)* column for each difficulty level determines the highest value that needs to be rolled to succeed.
 
 For example, for an *average* action (which has an AT of 5), you would succeed on a roll of 1-5, while for an *unattainable* action (AT 1), only a 1 would succeed. It is expected that tasks that could be considered easier than average will succeed automatically, unless your adventurer is trying to perform under stressful or difficult circumstances. At that point, the coordinator will determine an appropriate difficulty level for the action.

## Combat

In real life, combat consists of multiple actions taking place almost simultaneously. However, this is extremely difficult (if not impossible) to achieve in a tabletop game. Therefore, we will slice time and movement using a system composed of *rounds* and *turns*, with the order of events set through *initiative*.

### Initiative

At the start of combat, all players and the coordinator will roll a die as specified in the following table:

| Factor               | Die |
|----------------------|-----|
| No armor             | d6  |
| Leather/padded armor | d8  |
| Mail armor           | d10 |
| Plate armor          | d12 |

If a participant is carrying a lot of weight or a bulky item, they will bump up their die to the next higher value. For example, the player of a fighter wearing leather armor that is carrying a backpack fully stuffed to the top with coins will roll a d10 for their initiative instead of a d8. The coordinator must be reasonable and fair when determining this.

#### Enemies and monsters

The coordinator will roll for each monster *group*, although they can choose to roll initiative for each opponent if they wish to. For humanoid opponents, use the same table as for adventurers to determine the initiative die. Monsters and beasts will have their own die as determined in their description.

The action order will then be established by the roll results in *ascending* order. In the case of a tie between adventurers, the players choose who goes first. If the tie is between a player and any of the coordinator's group of enemies, the player will go first. The coordinator must annotate the initiative order for reference.

### Rounds and turns

Once the initiative is set, combat begins! This is the start of the round, which encompasses all the plays by all participants. Each player participates in their turn, as set by the initiative order.

### Move
 
If able to do so, combat participants can move before *or* after their attack, and as an action in their *riposte* (explained below). They can also choose to not move at all. Movement, like weapon range, is defined in zones. Your adventurer can move a maximum of 1 zone per  

### Attack

To perform an attack, roll the *adventurer* profession die, or d20 if it is an entity with no fighting abilities. The AT for an attack is equal to the target's defense score. This can be further modified by the following:

- Cover: Being behind 50% or more cover will reduce their defense by -2 in addition to any other benefits such as armor.
- There might be additional factors from -1 to -5 that are related to things like magic, or a creature's special characteristic.

Regardless of the target's defense, a roll of 1 will always hit a target under regular circumstances.

### Riposte

The target of an attack, if still conscious and capable, can immediately strike back in return even if it is not their turn in terms of initiative. This is called a riposte, and it makes combat more dynamic, dangerous, and unpredictable. The target of a riposte cannot riposte in return.

Even after playing their riposte, they will still get to play their turn as originally set by initiative, and in the same manner their target will be able to respond back to the attack with their own riposte, if possible.

### Damage

The wellbeing die is used to manage damage received in combat or other dangerous situations. There are two tracking scores related to wellbeing, *hit points (HP)* and *injury points (IN)*. Every time a combatant is the target of a successful attack (or anything else that causes bodily or mental harm), add 1 HP. For example, on the first successful attack they will have 1 HP, second time, 2 HP, and so on.

After jotting this down, the player rolls their wellbeing die. If the roll is higher than the combatant's current HP, they avoid being injured. If the roll is equal or lower than their HP, the player has to add the damage points to their current IN score based on the attack's damage value.

If the combatant reaches an IN score higher than their wellbeing die (for example, reaching 9 or more IN when their wellbeing die is a d8), they will automatically be *unconscious* and out of commission.

#### Death

If the combatant receives more than one and a half times their wellbeing die in injury points, they will die. For example, an adventurer with a wellbeing of d6 will die if they receive more than 9 IN.

| WB  | Death at |
|-----|----------|
| d4  | 6 IN     |
| d6  | 9 IN     |
| d8  | 12 IN    |
| d10 | 15 IN    |
| d12 | 18 IN    |
| d20 | 30 IN    |

Note that there are WB values higher and lower than what is usually expected from adventurers. This takes into account certain creatures that might have such extremely scores.

## Monsters and creatures

In this fantasy world, strange creatures and monsters can be found lurking anywhere... Yes, even in the basement of the inn you are staying at! Some creatures are friendly, many are neutral, and others are vicious and evil.

Creatures work quite similarly to adventurers in terms of game mechanics.

- Wellbeing: A creature can have a wellbeing die from d4 (a really small creature) to d20 (a large, powerful beast).
- Attack: Instead of having an *adventurer* profession to determine their combat prowess, a monster has an *attack (A)* die. This die can range from d4 (for a truly powerful creature) to d20.
- Defense: Monsters will have a set *defense (D)* score from 2 to 5. For humanoid creatures, this will be determined by armor type, or any natural armor they could have.
- Powers and abilities: Any power and abilities will have an assigned die. Unlike adventurers, however, dice assignments do not have to be unique, providing more flexibility in monster design. Note that humanoid monsters can have professions just like adventurers.

Here are some examples:

- Goblin - WBd4, Ad10, D5/Armor.
- Owlbear - WBd10, Ad8, D3.
