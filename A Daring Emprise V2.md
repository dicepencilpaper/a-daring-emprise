# A Daring Emprise
Medieval fantasy role-playing game by Dice Pencil and paper.

## Welcome, daring adventurer!

This is a world of...

## Participants

A session of A Daring Emprise is composed of one to four people that will be controlling their *adventurers*, and one player who is in charge of presenting the situations, scenes, and controlling the rest of the universe's entities. This player is known as the *coordinator*, as they take care of running the game in an orderly fashion and making sure things are fair for everyone.

## The adventurer

Asa player, you participate in this world through your *adventurer*, a daring, courageous individual that is ready to face whatever fate throws at them! Your adventurer will have two to four _professions_, which determine the skills and abilities they possess. The number of professions picked is up to the player.
 
### Professions

A profession encompasses a relatively wide skill set. Here are a few examples for some professions:

- Metalsmith
- Merchant
- Thief
- Explorer
- Painter
- Politician
- Soldier
- Musician

 Note that professions do not have expressly detailed skills and abilities; rather, it is expected that everyone uses common sense and creativity when using professions. Does an action performed under a certain profession makes sense to everyone? Then it is valid! For example, it is expected that someone with the profession of _musician_ is good at understanding musical instruments, composition, and knowledgeable of music history. But a creative use of this profession could enable them to be really good at persuading people, simply based on their experience as public performers. Be flexible and creative!

All adventurers have one basic profession, *adventurer*, which determines their proficiency in the following areas:

- Combat prowess and skill with basic weapons. This does not include advanced martial weapons like a trebuchet, siege engines, and such.
- Travel skills such as basic map reading, and a good sense of direction. 
- Basic survival techniques like setting camp, building fires, cooking, fishing, small-prey hunting, and foraging.

To determine how proficient the adventurer is at each on of their professions, assign a die to each one based on your personal preference, with *d6* being way above average, all the way down to below average at *d12*. Each die assignment must be unique.

As an example, Runah the Wanderer has the following professions:

- Hunter (d6)
- Adventurer (d8)
- Sailor (d10)

When your adventurer is trying to perform a task for which they have no knowledge, you will have to roll for success using the *d20* die.

### Wellbeing 

The *wellbeing* die determines your adventurer's physical and mental resistance. Usually, your adventurer starts with **d8** as their wellbeing die. There are two tracking scores related to wellbeing, *hits* and *wounds*. Every time your adventurer is the target of a successful attack (or anything that causes bodily or mental harm), add 1 to your hits score. This means that the first time your adventurer receives damage, hits would be 1, second time receiving damage hits goes up to 2, and so on.

After jotting this down, roll your wellbeing die. If you roll a number higher than your current hits, your adventurer avoids being wounded. If you roll equal or lower than your hits, you will add a certain amount to your current wounds score, based on the intensity of the attack.

If your adventurer reaches a wounds score higher than their wellbeing die value (for example, getting 9 or more wounds when your wellbeing die is a d8), your adventurer will automatically be *unconscious* and out of commission.

#### Assigning your wellbeing die

There are two methods for this. The first one is to roll randomly for it wusing a d20, and consulting the table below:

| Roll 1d20 | Wellbeing Die |
|-----------|---------------|
| 1-10      | d6            |
| 11-15     | d8            |
| 16-18     | d10           |
| 19-20     | d12           |

The second alternative is to have the coordinator assign a die value based on your adventurer's professions; someone with a focus on highly-physical activities such as a soldier could have a high wellbeing die, while someone that comes from a very sedentary lifestyle would have a lower die.

## Actions

Any activity or task that requires knowledge and skill is called an *action*. Every action has a difficulty range as shown below:

| Difficulty   | Max Success Value |
|--------------|-------------------|
| Average      | 5                 |
| Complicated  | 4                 |
| Difficult    | 3                 |
| Brutal       | 2                 |
| Unattainable | 1                 |

 The *max success value* column for each difficulty level determines the maximum value that needs to be rolled on a die to succeed at an action. For example, for an *average* action, you would succeed on a roll of 1-5, while for an *unattainable* action, only a 1 would succeed. It is expected that tasks that could be considered easier than average will succeed automatically, unless your adventurer is trying to perform under stressful or difficult circumstances. At that point, the coordinator will determine an appropriate difficulty level for the action.

Actions include combat maneuvers. Speaking of which...

## Combat

Actual combat consists of multiple actions taking place simultaneously. However, this is extremely difficult (if not impossible) to achieve in a game. Therefore, we will use a system composed of *rounds* and *turns*, with the order set through *initiative*.

### Initiative

At the start of combat, all players and the coordinator will roll 1d8 each. The action order will then be established by the roll results in ascending order. The coordinator must take care to annotate the initiative order for reference.

### Rounds and turns

Once the initiative is set, combat begins! This is the start of the round, which encompasses all the plays by all participants. Each player participates in their turn, as set by the initiative order.

### Attacks

To perform an attack, you use the *adventurer* die roll. The difficulty level of the attack is set by comparing your attack die against your opponent's attack die, and use the table below to determine the maximum success value.

| Opponent =>  | d6 | d8 | d10 | d12 | d20 | 
|--------------|----|----|-----|-----|-----|
| **Attacker** |    |    |     |     |     | 
| d6           | 3  | 4  | 5   | 5   | 5   |
| d8           | 2  | 3  | 4   | 5   | 5   |
| d10          | 1  | 2  | 3   | 4   | 5   |
| d12          | 1  | 1  | 2   | 3   | 4   |
| d20          | 1  | 1  | 1   | 2   | 3   |

As an example, if your adventurer uses a d8 for their strike, and your opponent has a d10 as their attack die, you need to roll 1-5 to succeed on your attack. 

The target of an attack, if still conscious and capable, can immediately respond back to the attack, even if it is not their turn in terms of initiative. This makes combat more dynamic, dangerous, and unpredictable. Even after responding to an attack, they will still get to play their turn as determined by initiative, and in the same manner, their target will be able to respond back to the attack.

### Armor and shield

Your adventurer can wear armor and wield a shield. Light armor increases your wellbeing rolls by +1, and heavy armor does the same by +2. Wearing a shield reduces the attack roll value by -1.
