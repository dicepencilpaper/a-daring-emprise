## Welcome!

This is a world of low fantasy and high stakes! Take your adventurer to dangerous quests into dark caves, mysterious dungeons, mystical towers, and more. It is a world of low technology, warring kingdoms, and dangerous monsters lurking everywhere. Be courageous, be brave, don your armor, and create stories that will be retold for ages!

### Participants

A session of A Daring Emprise is composed of one to four people that will be playing with their _adventurers_, and one player who is in charge of presenting the situations, scenes, and controlling the rest of the universe's entities. This player is known as the _coordinator_, as they take care of running the game in an orderly fashion and making sure things are fair for everyone.

## The adventurer

Your adventurer is a daring, courageous individual that is ready to face whatever fate throws at them! An adventurer has one to four _professions_ that define their skills and capabilities. Each one of these abilities gets a dice assigned to it. The lower the die, the better they are at that profession. These determine the adventurer's skills and capabilities. The lower the die, the better it is.

### Professions

A profession encompasses a relatively wide skill set. Here are a few examples of some possible professions:

*   Metalsmith
*   Merchant
*   Thief
*   Explorer
*   Painter
*   Politician
*   Soldier
*   Musician

Note that professions do not have detailed skills and abilities; rather, it is expected that everyone uses common sense and creativity when using professions. Does an action performed under a certain profession makes sense to everyone? Then it is valid!

For example, it is expected that someone with the profession of _musician_ is good at understanding musical instruments, composition, and knowledgeable of music history. But a creative use of this profession could enable them to be really good at persuading people, simply based on their experience as public performers. Be flexible and creative.

All adventurers have one basic profession, _adventurer_, which determines their proficiency in the following areas:

*   Combat prowess and skill with basic weapons. This does not include martial weapons, as clarified in the _Combat_ section.
*   Travel skills such as basic map reading, and a good sense of direction.
*   Basic survival techniques like setting camp, building fires, cooking, fishing, small-prey hunting, and foraging.

To determine how proficient the adventurer is at each on of their professions, they will had a single die assigned to each profession. The dice available are d6, d8, d10, and d12. Assign a die to each one based on your personal preference, with **d6** being way above average, all the way down to below average at **d12**. Each die assignment must be unique.

As an example, Runah the Wanderer has the following professions:

*   Hunter (d6)
*   Adventurer (d8)
*   Sailor (d10)

When your adventurer is trying to perform a task for which they have no knowledge, you will have to roll for success using the **d20** die. These dice are used to determine the success or failure of special actions that require skill. The _Actions_ section explains how this works.

### Wellbeing

The _wellbeing die (WB)_ determines your adventurer's physical and mental resistance. Usually, your adventurer starts with **d8** as their wellbeing die. A higher wellbeing die indicates a more robust adventurer.

#### Assigning your adventurer's wellbeing die

There are two methods for this. The first one is to roll 1d10 and consulting the table below:

Roll 1d10

Wellbeing Die

1-3

d6

4-7

d8

8-9

d10

10

d12

The second alternative is to have the coordinator assign a die value based on your adventurer's professions. As an example, an adventurer with a profession that focuses on highly physical activities such as a soldier could have a high wellbeing die, while someone that comes from a very sedentary lifestyle like a scholar would have a lower die.

### Weapons, armor, & equipment

Your adventurer needs to be equipped for the dangers they will face exploring the unknown! Make sure to give your character gear that matches their professions and style.

#### Weapons

There are three types of weapons: _light (L)_, _heavy (H)_ and _martial (M)_. Depending on the type, some weapons provide a bonus that increases the chances of a successful attack against an opponent, as detailed in the _Combat_ section. Martial weapons can only be used by those who have a profession that relates to the military or other similar experience.

Some weapons have another characteristic: _range_. This indicates the farthest reach for that weapon when it is fired or thrown. Range is measured in _zones_, with 1 zone being equal to 25 ft / 8 m. A zone of 0 indicates melee range.

#### Armor

Your adventurer can wear armor to protect them from physical damage. Similar to weapons, armor has light, heavy, and martial types, and only adventurers with a profession that provides extensive combat training can wear martial type armor.

Your adventurer has a base _Defense_ score of 5, which can be reduced by the _defense reduction_ value shown in the table below. The lower the score, the better protected your adventurer is.

Armor

Defense Reduction

Light (padded, leather)

\-1

Heavy (chainmail, scale mail)

\-2

Martial (plate mail)

\-3

Shield (any size)

Additional -1

#### Gear

In addition to weapons, your adventurer needs some gear that will keep them safe in their travels, as well as keeping them fed and hydrated. This includes items like rations, a waterskin, torches, a lamp, rope, and other items that can help on an adventure. Not having a required item for an action can result in an increased difficulty for the action target!

Actions
-------

Any activity or task that requires knowledge and skill is called an _action_. This includes using your adventurer's profession skills, and also combat actions such as attacking a target. Every action has a difficulty range as shown below:

Difficulty

Action Target

Average

5

Complicated

4

Difficult

3

Brutal

2

Unattainable

1

The _action target (AT)_ column for each difficulty level determines the highest value that needs to be rolled to succeed.

For example, for an _average_ action (which has an AT of 5), you would succeed on a roll of 1-5, while for an _unattainable_ action (AT 1), only a 1 would succeed. It is expected that tasks that could be considered easier than average will succeed automatically, unless your adventurer is trying to perform under stressful or difficult circumstances. At that point, the coordinator will determine an appropriate difficulty level for the action.

Combat
------

In real life, combat consists of multiple actions taking place almost simultaneously. However, this is extremely difficult (if not impossible) to achieve in a tabletop game. Therefore, we will slice time and movement using a system composed of _rounds_ and _turns_, with the order of events set through _initiative_.

[Back to Contents](#contents)

### Initiative

At the start of combat, all players and the coordinator will roll a die as specified in the following table:

Factor

Die

No armor

d6

Leather/padded armor

d8

Mail armor

d10

Plate armor

d12

If a participant is carrying a lot of weight or a bulky item, they will bump up their die to the next higher value. For example, the player of a fighter wearing leather armor that is carrying a backpack fully stuffed to the top with coins will roll a d10 for their initiative instead of a d8. The coordinator must be reasonable and fair when determining this.

#### Enemies and monsters

The coordinator will roll for each monster _group_, although they can choose to roll initiative for each opponent if they wish to. For humanoid opponents, use the same table as for adventurers to determine the initiative die. Monsters and beasts will have their own die as determined in their description.

The action order will then be established by the roll results in _ascending_ order. In the case of a tie between adventurers, the players choose who goes first. If the tie is between a player and any of the coordinator's group of enemies, the player will go first. The coordinator must annotate the initiative order for reference.

[Back to Contents](#contents)

### Rounds & turns

Once the initiative is set, combat begins! This is the start of the round, which encompasses all the plays by all participants. Each player participates in their turn, as set by the initiative order.

[Back to Contents](#contents)

### Moving

If able to do so, combat participants can move before _or_ after their attack, and as an action in their _riposte_ (explained below). They can also choose to not move at all. Movement, like weapon range, is defined in zones. Your adventurer can move a maximum of 1 zone per turn.

[Back to Contents](#contents)

### Attacking

To perform an attack, roll the _adventurer_ profession die, or d20 if it is an entity with no fighting abilities. The AT for an attack is equal to the target's defense score. This can be further modified by the following:

*   Being behind 50% or more cover will reduce their defense by -2 in addition to any other benefits such as armor.
*   There might be additional factors from -1 to -5 that are related to things like magic, or a creature's special characteristic.

Regardless of the target's defense, a roll of 1 will always hit a target under regular circumstances.

#### Weapon bonuses

Some weapons have an attack modifier based on their type. This modifier is added to the attack roll, improving the chances of a successful hit.

None

Heavy

Martial

### Riposte

The target of an attack, if still conscious and capable, can immediately strike back in return even if it is not their turn in terms of initiative. This is called a riposte, and it makes combat more dynamic, dangerous, and unpredictable. The target of a riposte cannot riposte in return.

Even after playing their riposte, they will still get to play their turn as originally set by initiative, and in the same manner their target will be able to respond back to the attack with their own riposte, if possible.

[Back to Contents](#contents)

### Damage

Every time a combatant is the target of a successful attack, their player keeps track of this via _hit points (HP)_, adding 1 for every attack. After adding up their hit, the player rolls their wellbeing die. If they roll higher than their current HP _or_ the maximum value of their wellbeing die, they avoid being injured, otherwise, they will be out of commission and unconscious.

After this, any attacks received are automatically successful.

#### Death

If the combatant receives more than half times their wellbeing die in injuries, they will die. For example, an adventurer with a wellbeing of d6 will die if they receive more than 3 injuries.

Monsters & creatures
--------------------

In this fantasy world, strange creatures and monsters can be found lurking anywhere... Yes, even in the basement of the inn you are staying at! Some creatures are friendly, many are neutral, and others are vicious and evil.

Creatures work quite similarly to adventurers in terms of game mechanics.

*   **Wellbeing:** A creature can have a wellbeing die from d4 (a really small creature) to d20 (a large, powerful beast).
*   **Attack:** Instead of having an _adventurer_ profession to determine their combat prowess, a monster has an _attack (A)_ die. This die can range from d4 (for a truly powerful creature) to d20.
*   **Defense:** Monsters will have a set _defense (D)_ score from 2 to 5. For humanoid creatures, this will be determined by armor type, or any natural armor they could have.
*   **Powers and abilities:** Any power and abilities will have an assigned die. Unlike adventurers, however, dice assignments do not have to be unique, providing more flexibility in monster design. Note that humanoid monsters can have professions just like adventurers.

Here are some examples:

*   **Goblin** - Wd4, Ad10, D5/Armor.
*   **Owlbear** - Wd10, Ad8, D3.
