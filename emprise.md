## Welcome!

This is a world of fantasy and high stakes! Take your adventurer to dangerous quests into dark caves, mysterious dungeons, mystical towers, and more. It is a world of low technology, warring kingdoms, and dangerous monsters lurking everywhere. Be courageous, be brave, don your armor, and create stories that will be retold for ages!

This system is designed so that most adventure settings can be adapted to it. Similarly, you can create your own world and lore, and the Emprise system should be able to work quite well with it.

### Participants

A session of Emprise is composed of one to four people that will be playing with their _adventurers_, and one player who is in charge of presenting the situations, scenes, and controlling the rest of the universe's entities. This player is known as the _Coordinator_, as they take care of running the game in an orderly fashion and making sure things are fair for everyone.

### Components needed

To set up and play a game of Emprise, you will need the following:

* Paper for noting the adventurer's stats and description, and for the Coordinator to take notes. Any type of paper works.
* Pencils or pens for writing.
* At least one full set of polyhedral dice: d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, and d20. However, it is ideal if every participant has their own set of dice.

## The adventurer

Your adventurer is a daring, courageous individual that is ready to face whatever fate throws at them! An adventurer has one to four _professions_ that define their skills and capabilities. Each one of these abilities gets a dice assigned to it. The lower the die, the better they are at that profession. These determine the adventurer's skills and capabilities. The lower the die, the better it is.

### Creating an adventurer

There are four dice available for each adventurer. These dice are: d6, d8, d10, and d12. The lower a die, the better it is. These are assigned as follows to your adventurer's character elements:

* One die for _[adventuring skills](#adventuring-skills)_.
* One to three dice for _[professions](#professions)_, or
* One to two dice for professions, and one die for _[magic](#magic)_. 

You can assign these dice as you wish, however, dice assignments cannot be repeated; for example, you cannot assign a d6 to two different character elements. Each die must be unique to each element.

## Adventuring skills

Every adventurer has, of course, adventuring skills! This covers a practical knowledge set comprised of the following elements:

* **Fighting:** The adventurer knows how to fight with or without weapons, use armor, and shields. They can also perform maneuvers during combat.
* **Traveling:** They will have a decent sense of direction, and know how to travel in different types of terrain. They will also possess basic knowledge of the dangers in each.
* **Camping:*** The adventurer knows the basics of setting up camp: shelter, fire, and related things.

## Professions

A profession encompasses a relatively wide skill and knowledge set. Here are a few examples of possible professions:

*   Metalsmith
*   Merchant
*   Thief
*   Explorer
*   Painter
*   Politician
*   Soldier
*   Musician

Note that professions do not have detailed, granular skills and abilities; rather, it is expected that everyone uses common sense and creativity when using professions. Does an action performed under a certain profession makes sense to everyone? Then it is valid!

For example, it is expected that someone with the profession of _musician_ is good at understanding musical instruments, composition, and knowledgeable of music history. But a creative use of this profession could enable them to be really good at persuading people, simply based on their experience as public performers. Be flexible and creative.

Professions are utilized via _[actions](#actions)_, explained later in these rules.

## Weapons, armor, & equipment

Your adventurer needs to be equipped for the dangers they will face exploring the unknown! Make sure to give your character gear that matches their professions and style.

### Weapons

There are three types of weapons: _light (L)_, _medium (M)_, and _heavy (H)_. Medium and heavy weapons provide a negative dice shift that increases the chances of a successful attack against an opponent. Heavy weapons can only be used by those who have a profession that relates to the military or other similar experience, like being a soldier or a knight.

| Weapon type | Dice Shift |
|-------------|------------|
| Light       | 0          |
| Medium      | -1         |
| Heavy       | -2         |

Missile and thrown weapons have another characteristic: _range_. This indicates the farthest reach for that weapon when it is used. There are five ranges.

| Range         | Distance    |
|---------------|-------------|
| Immediate (I) | 5 ft/2 m    |
| Close (C)     | 25 ft/8 m   |
| Nearby (N)    | 50 ft/15 m  |
| Far (F)       | 100 ft/30 m |
| Distant (D)   | 200 ft/60 m |

#### Weapon list

| Weapon             | Type | Range | 2H |
|--------------------|------|-------|----|
| Battle axe         | M    |       |    |
| Bow                | M    | D     | X  |
| Crossbow           | H    | F     | X  |
| Dagger             | L    | C     |    |
| Great axe          | H    |       | X  |
| Hammer             | L    | I     |    |
| Hand axe           | L    | C     |    |
| Long sword         | M    |       |    |
| Mace               | M    |       |    |
| Sling              | L    | F     |    |
| Short sword        | L    |       |    |
| Two-handed sword   | H    |       | X  |
| Warhammer          | M    |       |    |

Note that weapons marked as two-handed (2H) cannot be used simultaneously with a shield.

#### Armor

Your adventurer can wear armor to protect them from physical damage. Similar to weapons, armor is available in light, medium, and heavy types, and only adventurers with a profession that provides extensive combat training can wear heavy armor. Armor protects by applying a positive dice shift to the attacker's roll.

| Armor                          | Dice Shift | 
|--------------------------------|------------|
| Light (padded, leather)        | +1         |
| Medium (chainmail, scale mail) | +2         |
| Heavy (plate mail)             | +3         |
| Shield (any size)              | Add +1     |

#### Gear

In addition to weapons, your adventurer needs some gear that will keep them safe in their travels, as well as keeping them fed and hydrated. This includes items like rations, a waterskin, torches, a lamp, rope, and other items that can help on an adventure. Not having a required item for an action can prevent an adventurer in performing a certain action. Also, in some cases (as judged by the Coordinator), having the correct gear for an action will provide DS -1 to the roll.

## Actions

Any activity or task that requires knowledge and skill is called an _action_. This includes using your adventurer's profession skills, and combat actions such as attacking a target. To perform an action related to a profession or adventuring skills, roll the appropriate die and consult the following table:

| Value rolled | Result           |
|--------------|------------------|
| 1            | Critical success |
| 2            | Success          |
| 3            | Near failure     |
| 4+           | Failure          |

* **Critical success:** The adventurer's action excels; not only do they succeed, they can optionally ask for an additional related effect from their action (to be discussed with the Coordinator as not to imbalance things).
* **Success:** The action succeeded as intended by the player.
* **Near failure:** The action succeeded, but barely. A negative side effect of the action can happen at the discretion of the Coordinator. As with a critical success, this effect has to be measured and not imbalance events unnecessarily.

_Coordinator's Note: It is recommended that you exercise balance regarding when to roll. Excessive rolls bog down the game; only roll for things that you consider will require a special application of the adventurer's profession. Be fair, and keep the game flowing. However, tasks that would normally succeed automatically could require a roll if the is trying to perform under stressful or difficult circumstances._

### Difficulty modifiers

Not all actions are equal, and some will be harder to perform than others. In those cases, a _dice shift (DS)_ will be set by the Coordinator for the action. Dice shifts can be positive (rolling a higher-numbered die) or negative (rolling a lower-numbered die).

| Difficulty   | Dice shift |
|--------------|------------|
| Average      | 0          |
| Difficult    | +1         |
| Brutal       | +2         |
| Unattainable | +3         |

For example, an adventurer with Adventuring d8 wants to shoot an arrow into a small hall in a wall that is quite a distance away. The Coordinator evaluates the situation and determines it's a Brutal difficulty (DS +2). Therefore, the player now must roll a d12 to determine if they're successful in their action.

### Performing actions without a profession

When your adventurer is trying to perform an action for which they have no knowledge, you will have to roll for success using the d20 die, and consult the table above.

## Combat

In real life, combat consists of multiple actions taking place almost simultaneously. However, this is extremely difficult (if not impossible) to achieve in a tabletop game. Therefore, we will slice time and movement using a system composed of _rounds_ and _turns_, with the order of events set through _initiative_.

[Back to Contents](#contents)

### Initiative

At the start of combat, all players and the Coordinator will roll a die as specified in the following table:

| Factor               | Die |
|----------------------|-----|
| No armor             | d6  |
| Leather/padded armor | d8  |
| Mail armor           | d10 |
| Plate armor          | d12 |

If a participant is carrying a lot of weight or a bulky item, they will bump up their die to the next higher value. For example, the player of a fighter wearing leather armor that is carrying a backpack fully stuffed to the top with coins will roll a d10 for their initiative instead of a d8. The Coordinator must be reasonable and fair when determining this.

#### Enemies and monsters

The Coordinator will roll initiative for each monster _group_, although they can choose to roll initiative for each opponent if they wish to. For humanoid opponents, use the same table as for adventurers to determine the initiative die. Monsters and beasts will have their own die as determined in their description.

#### Acting order

The acting order for all battle participants is established by the roll results in _ascending_ order. In the case of a tie between adventurers, the players choose who goes first. If the tie is between a player and any of the Coordinator's group of enemies, the player will go first. The Coordinator must annotate the initiative order for reference.

[Back to Contents](#contents)

### Rounds & turns

Once the initiative is set, combat begins! This is the start of the round, which encompasses all the plays by all participants. Each player participates in their turn, as set by the initiative order.

[Back to Contents](#contents)

### Moving

If able to do so, combat participants can move before _or_ after their attack, and as an action in their _riposte_ (explained below). They can also choose to not move at all. Movement, like weapon range, is defined in zones. Your adventurer can move a maximum of 1 zone per turn.

[Back to Contents](#contents)

### Attacking

To perform an attack, roll the _adventurer_ profession die, or d20 if it is an entity with no fighting abilities. The AT for an attack is equal to the target's defense score. This can be further modified by the following:

* Being behind 50% or more cover will reduce their defense by -2 in addition to any other benefits such as armor.
* There might be additional factors from -1 to -5 that are related to things like magic, or a creature's special characteristic.

Regardless of the target's defense, a roll of 1 will always hit a target under regular circumstances.

#### Weapon bonuses

Some weapons have an attack modifier based on their type. This modifier is added to the attack roll, improving the chances of a successful hit.

### Riposte

The target of an attack, if still conscious and capable, can immediately strike back in return even if it is not their turn in terms of initiative. This is called a riposte, and it makes combat more dynamic, dangerous, and unpredictable. The target of a riposte cannot riposte in return.

Even after playing their riposte, they will still get to play their turn as originally set by initiative, and in the same manner their target will be able to respond back to the attack with their own riposte, if possible.

[Back to Contents](#contents)

### Damage

Every time a combatant is the target of a successful attack, their player keeps track of this via _hit points (HP)_, adding 1 for every attack. After adding up their hit, the player rolls their wellbeing die. If they roll higher than their current HP _or_ the maximum value of their wellbeing die, they avoid being injured, otherwise, they will be out of commission and unconscious.

After this, any attacks received are automatically successful.

#### Death

If the combatant receives more than half times their wellbeing die in injuries, they will die. For example, an adventurer with a wellbeing of d6 will die if they receive more than 3 injuries.

Monsters & creatures
--------------------

In this fantasy world, strange creatures and monsters can be found lurking anywhere... Yes, even in the basement of the inn you are staying at! Some creatures are friendly, many are neutral, and others are vicious and evil.

Creatures work quite similarly to adventurers in terms of game mechanics.

*   **Wellbeing:** A creature can have a wellbeing die from d4 (a really small creature) to d20 (a large, powerful beast).
*   **Attack:** Instead of having an _adventurer_ profession to determine their combat prowess, a monster has an _attack (A)_ die. This die can range from d4 (for a truly powerful creature) to d20.
*   **Defense:** Monsters will have a set _defense (D)_ score from 2 to 5. For humanoid creatures, this will be determined by armor type, or any natural armor they could have.
*   **Powers and abilities:** Any power and abilities will have an assigned die. Unlike adventurers, however, dice assignments do not have to be unique, providing more flexibility in monster design. Note that humanoid monsters can have professions just like adventurers.

Here are some examples:

*   **Goblin** - Wd4, Ad10, D5/Armor.
*   **Owlbear** - Wd10, Ad8, D3.
